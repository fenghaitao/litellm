GitHub Copilot Embedding Handler

This module handles GitHub Copilot embedding requests using the custom_httpx HTTP handler.
Request/Response transformation is handled in transformation.py.

# The actual HTTP handling is delegated to the custom_httpx handler.
# This file serves as a placeholder to maintain consistency with other providers
# and can be extended in the future if GitHub Copilot-specific handling is needed.
